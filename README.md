# Claude Code Authentication Switcher

A macOS utility that allows switching between Claude Code personal plan authentication and API billing authentication using macOS Keychain.

Run `./ccs.sh` to interactively switch between authentication methods or use command line arguments like `./ccs.sh personal` or `./ccs.sh api`.

Requires macOS and `jq` (install with `brew install jq`).
